Operating system: An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources. 
It acts as an intermediary between the user and the computer, allowing users to interact with the device without needing to understand the complexities of the hardware. 
The OS handles tasks like memory management, process management, file management, and input/output operations.
